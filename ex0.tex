\chapter{Exercise 0: The Setup}

This is how you setup your computer to work through this book.  Here's an example of including
some code:

\begin{code}{ex0.py}
<< d['code/ex0.py|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

Here is what the output of that program would look like:
\begin{code}{ex0.py}
<< d['code/ex0.py|py|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

And here's an example of including a basic text file:

\begin{code}{ex0.txt}
<< d['code/ex0.txt'] >>
\end{code}

Here's an example writing some code inline:

\begin{code}{Building ex0}
\begin{Verbatim}
make ex0
./ex0
\end{Verbatim}
\end{code}
