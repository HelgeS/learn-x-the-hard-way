\chapter{Exercise 0: The Setup}

This is how you setup your computer to work through this book.  Here's an example of including
some code:

\begin{code}{ex1.c}
<< d['code/ex1.c|pyg|l'] >>
\end{code}

Here's what including an example output would look like:

\begin{code}{ex1.txt}
<< d['code/ex1.txt'] >>
\end{code}

Here's an example of doing some code right here:

\begin{code}{Building ex1}
\begin{Verbatim}
make ex1
./ex1
\end{Verbatim}
\end{code}
